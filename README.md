*Abstract*-Mental health illness is a significant global public
health threat exacerbated by the lack of effective early
identification and intervention measures. This project aims to
address these challenges by focusing on mental health
recognition among homeless children. Individuals who are
particularly vulnerable due to the loss of their parents. We
created a model that screens mental health status by analyzing
the responses to screening pediatric symptoms checklist (PSC)
questions using an SVM algorithm. This model achieved 90%
accuracy in predicting the mental health status of children. This
approach makes it more accessible and effective for caretakers
in orphan homes. The idea of providing some clear guidelines
from the obtained results would make sure these children are
well taken care of at the right time, which ultimately improves
the mental health status of this group of people.
